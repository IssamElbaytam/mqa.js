# mqa.js (meqa.js)
A small, modern library for managing media queries programmatically (i.e. in JavaScript).
Most media query libraries I've seen forces the developer to duplicate their media query syntaxes (from CSS file to JavaScript file). See the documentation for more information and how to use the API.

# Browser support
This is a rather quick hack and I haven't tested it on all modern browsers, however, every browser that supports `window.matchMedia` and Array Extras should be fine. Currently tested on Firefox 19, Safari 6, Chrome 24.

# TODO
* Test with polyfills and see how much work there is to get IE9 to work
* Unit tests (mocha)
* Build system (grunt)
